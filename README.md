This project is a basic web application built using Java and the Spring Boot framework. 
The goal is to create a dynamic greeting page that responds to user input via a URL parameter.
When a user visits the /greeting endpoint with an optional name parameter, 
the application generates a personalized greeting message.
The name is displayed on the webpage alongside a static image, offering a simple and user-friendly interface.
The application uses the Thymeleaf template engine to render the HTML page dynamically.
Static content like images is stored in the appropriate directory and served alongside the web page for a better looking website.
